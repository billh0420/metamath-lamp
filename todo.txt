- add an int test when a hyp is used in a bottom-up proof being applied.
- rename rootStmt.justification to jstf and other related fields.
- rename stmtJstfDto to jstfDto.
-fix a bug: in bottom-up proof dialog, when applying selected statements, jstf should be set not only for the stmt being proved but for other unproved root stmts too.
    1. load set.mm, read all
    2. load my-editor-state.json
    3. unify bottom-up. stmt14 (ralbidv, depth=4, length=less, no new vars). The statement gets proved via [stmt13 : ralbidv ]
    4. apply.
    5. stmt13 is still unproved, stmt14 is "waiting".
- new settings in bottom-up dialog:
    - max number of parents
    - debug mode on/off
- discouraged assertions
- possibility to select root statements in bottom-up dialog.
- proof tree improvements:
    - pass error icon from src to all unproved children
    - 1000 items per page
    - sort srcs by var type, hyp, asrt
    - filter by asrt, min number of srcs
- error messages for some specific cases (number of args doesn't match, could not prove type of floating, etc.)
- fix the bug discovered in save-proofs-to-files
- In prove bottom up, similar to checks for var types and hyps, also check assertions without eHyps for node.dist==maxDepth.

- fix a bug:
    1. start proving sgnval.
    2. after the first bottom-up proof, repeat the same bottom-up proof: results will contain 2 duplicated items.

- write tests for collecting debug info
- restrict names of labels due to the error:
    ?Error on line 732616 of file "set-check-new-proofs.mm" at statement 203351,
    label "1", type "$e":
            1 $e |- ch $.
            ^
    This label has the same name as the math token declared on line 108187 of file

- implement table view in the editor.
- don't remove vars prefixed with an exclamation mark.
- tooltip: To start a new line in a multiline text editor press Shift+Enter
- load *.mm files from metamath.org
- add onEnter and onEscape wherever possible.
- fix a bug:
    1. load set.mm, read all
    2. load my-editor-state.json
    3. unify all. stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2 are "waiting"
    4. remove jstf of stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2
    5. unify all. stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2 are "cannot find jstf"
- Make new stmt prefix configurable.
- before merging of statements check if some statements should be moved up because they are referenced by above statements and don't merge in that case.
- autofocus label selector after scope is set to StopBefore or StopAfter
- in cmp_search use array2.slice and store idx in the rendered elem the same way as in cmp_bottom_up
- add an int test with few hypotheses.
- apply colors to search results, substitutions.
- fix a bug:
    1) load an MM file, apply changes;
    2) load same file in the same file selector - nothing happens.
- prefix for new statements
- add logs to applyAssertions (using array)
- write tests for both versions of verifyDisjoints (in MM_subs and MM_wrk_editor)
- add possibility to comment statements
- make error messages more informative: add the statement caused the error (for example in "variables" or in justifications).
- write tests for editorState -> proofTree -> editorState.
- renaming of a statement should automatically rename all references (after user confirms this action).
- correct methods related to movement of statements, they became incorrect after automatic reordering.
- use Async/Await.
- precalculate number of combinations (store in an array)
- use uncurried functions everywhere
- replace a[i] with a->Js_array2.unsafe_get(i), or open Belt and replace with Option.getExn
