- load *.mm files from metamath.org
- add onEnter and onEscape wherever possible.
- fix a bug:
    1. load set.mm, read all
    2. load my-editor-state.json
    3. unify all. stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2 are "waiting"
    4. remove jstf of stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2
    5. unify all. stmt2-spcgv.11 and stmt2 are "cannot find jstf"
- Make new stmt prefix configurable.
- before merging of statements check if some statements should be moved up because they are referenced by above statements and don't merge in that case.
- autofocus label selector after scope is set to StopBefore or StopAfter
- in cmp_search use array2.slice and store idx in the rendered elem the same way as in cmp_bottom_up
- add an int test with few hypotheses.
- apply colors to search results, substitutions.
- fix a bug:
    1) load an MM file, apply changes;
    2) load same file in the same file selector - nothing happens.
- prefix for new statements
- add logs to applyAssertions (using array)
- write tests for both versions of verifyDisjoints (in MM_subs and MM_wrk_editor)
- add possibility to comment statements
- make error messages more informative: add the statement caused the error (for example in "variables" or in justifications).
- write tests for editorState -> proofTree -> editorState.
- renaming of a statement should automatically rename all references (after user confirms this action).
- correct methods related to movement of statements, they became incorrect after automatic reordering.
- use Async/Await.
- precalculate number of combinations (store in an array)
- use uncurried functions everywhere
- replace a[i] with a->Js_array2.unsafe_get(i), or open Belt and replace with Option.getExn
